| **Bea Nance**<br>Bea initiated the Kalico project together with MaÃ«l, forking the awesome Klipper firmware originally as "Danger-Klipper" to add some bleeding edge spice to it. <br> _"So I saw people wanted some community-driven features in klipper, so i was like "ehh, i'll just fork it and give it a go"_ | bwnance  | [@bwnance](https://github.com/bwnance)     |
| **MaÃ«l Kerbiriou**<br>MaÃ«l together with Bea brought Kalico to life.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               | piezoid  | [@Piezoid](https://github.com/Piezoid)     |
| **Rogerio Goncalves**<br>Roger chimed in early into the development of Kalico, and has since been a crucial contributor to the project.                                                                                                                                                                            | rogerlz  | [@rogerlz](https://github.com/rogerlz)     |
| **Frank Tackitt**<br>Frank started his klipper hacking with exclude_object and just forgot to stop there                                                                                                                                                                                                           | frank.af | [@kageurufu](https://github.com/kageurufu) |

| **Vinzenz Hassert**<br>_"Uhh dunno... I mean I did pid profiles, filament sensors and curve control mainly. And I am best at giving Roger grey hairs cause I do huge pull requests!"_                                                                                                | LastZeanon | [@LastZeanon](https://github.com/LastZeanon)         |
| **Yancey Arrington**<br>Yancey wrote the docs for all the bleeding edge features and model predictive control, otherwise you wouldn't know about all the fancy stuff Kalico brings to the table! He also helps other community members a lot with their questions. What a great guy! | Ray_Boy    | [@YanceyA](https://github.com/YanceyA)               |
| **Ryan Ghosh**<br>All Ryan cares about are the TradRack and Belay modules of Kalico. How selfish! (no, in fact, that is very generous. Thanks Ryan!)                                                                                                                                 | RyanG      | [@rsghosh](https://github.com/rsghosh)               |
| **Lasse Dalegaard**<br>Our secret consultant for roasting everything. He also contributed a lot more than he is willing to admit. Silly Lasse.                                                                                                                                       | dalegaard  | [@dalegaard](https://github.com/dalegaard)           |
| **Philipp Molitor**<br>Phil started hacking around with the docs because he does web stuff and 3D printers, and liked the Kalico Crew so much he just... stuck around.<br>_"Hehehe... I wrote this page!"_                                                                           | philm0     | [@PhilippMolitor](https://github.com/PhilippMolitor) |
