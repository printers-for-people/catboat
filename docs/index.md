# Welcome to the Kalico documentation!

Kalico is a community-maintained fork of the Klipper 3D-Printer firmware. 
It combines the power of a general purpose computer with one or more 
micro-controllers. See the [features](Features.md) document for more 
information on why you should use Kalico.

To begin using Kalico start by [installing](Installation.md) it. If you 
consider migrating from Klipper to Kalico, please read our dedicated
[migration guide](Migrating_from_Klipper.md).

Kalico is Free Software. Read the [documentation](Overview.md) or
view [the Kalico code on GitHub](https://github.com/KalicoCrew/kalico).

We depend on the generous support from our [sponsors](Sponsors.md).
