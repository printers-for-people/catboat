This directory defines the https://docs.kalico.gg website. The
site is hosted using "github pages". The
.github/workflows/cd-docs.yaml tool uses mkdocs (
https://www.mkdocs.org/ ) to automatically convert the markdown files
in the docs/ directory to html. In addition to the files in this
directory, the docs/CNAME file also controls the website generation.

To test deploy the main site locally one can use commands
similar to the following:

```bash
cd docs/_kalico/ # if you were in the repo root
uv venv
uv sync
uv run mkdocs serve
```
